> [!NOTE]
> This lab starts with a standalone `space-quiz` project for a guided tour, then uses the separate [Tailspin Toys template repository](https://github.com/github-samples/tailspin-toys) for the remaining lessons.


The **[GitHub Copilot app](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/github-copilot-app)** is a desktop application built on Copilot CLI that brings agent-driven development into a single, focused workspace. It adds parallel agent sessions, switchable session modes, shared canvases, and native GitHub issue and pull request management — including **Agent Merge**, which shepherds a pull request through rebases, review feedback, CI fixes, and merge.

Across these lessons you'll install the app, build and ship a standalone space quiz through a guided tour, then move into the Tailspin Toys project and its seeded backlog. You'll start with a small Tailspin change — adding a star rating — then add a custom instructions standard from an issue, build a filtering feature in an isolated agent session, and verify it with a reusable skill. You'll add the Playwright MCP server to explore the feature in a real browser, then climb a ladder of merge automation that ends with **Agent Merge** landing your pull request. Finally you'll collaborate on a shared canvas and automate recurring work — a complete loop from idea to merged feature.

## Prerequisites

Before attending this workshop, please ensure you have:

- [ ] A GitHub account with an active **Copilot Student, Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise** plan
- [ ] A computer running **macOS, Linux, or Windows**
- [ ] [Git installed][install-git] on your computer
- [ ] [Node.js 22 or newer][nodejs] installed on your computer

> [!TIP]
> No paid plan? Verified students can get GitHub Copilot for free through [GitHub Education][callout-student-plan-education]. The **Copilot Student** plan includes the agent, MCP, code review, and Copilot CLI features this workshop uses — so you can complete every harness with it.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the Copilot app runs on your own machine rather than in a codespace, [Lesson 0][ex0] walks you through installing the local prerequisites before you install the app.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise, your administrator must enable the **Copilot CLI** policy before you can use the app.
